# MNIST-Digit-Recognizer-Kaggle-99.4-Accuracy-Pytorch
This is a kaggle challenge competition in which my goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of hand-written images.I have used CNN to solve this problem and achieved 99.4% accuarcy on my test dataset when trained for 40 epochs.The projects was built on Pytorch.
